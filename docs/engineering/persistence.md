# Persistence and server contracts

Read before save, IndexedDB, migration or cloud changes. Paths are repository-relative.

### Persistence / career slots — P0 foundation

- IndexedDB access lives in `src/modules/db.js`; domain code should not open ad-hoc databases.
- Save envelope is **V2** with `schemaVersion` and stable `slotId`. Existing V1 `.pitch` saves migrate explicitly; future persistent changes must extend the ordered migration path rather than rely on ad-hoc backfills.
- Multiple careers are isolated by slot:
  - `legacy` keeps the original physical `pitch_fc` database so pre-P0 browsers remain discoverable;
  - deleting/resetting the legacy career **clears its stores in place** — do not physically delete/recreate that compatibility database;
  - generated career slots use separate `pitch_fc_slot_<slotId>` databases and may be physically deleted.
- New Career allocates an isolated slot only when a career/import is actually committed. Backing out must leave the existing active career untouched.
- Career Menu metadata contract: manager, club, season, league, league position, gameweek, last played, save schema version; UI adds active state separately.
- Local export/import and cloud save use the same versioned envelope/slot metadata contract.
- Cloud save API/D1 is slot-aware: rows are keyed by `(user_id, slot_id)`; pre-P0 cloud rows migrate to `legacy`.
- P1 legacy/current careers backfill living-world state through the existing migration/backfill path; do not require users to destroy a P0 career to gain the world model.
- P3 uses additive, idempotent player-row/domain backfills and does not increment `DB_VERSION` merely to add fields to existing rows. Preserve that pattern for compatible player-contract extensions.

## 4) Server/cloud boundary

- `functions/` is Pitch's only server-side code: Worker request routing, Google OAuth/session support and D1 cloud saves.
- Pitch remains playable without an account; server authority is not required for core single-player simulation.
- `functions/_worker.js` manually dispatches API routes then falls through to `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)`.
- D1 migrations live in `migrations/`; P0 added the slot-aware saves migration. Treat migration order as production data history.
- Never put secrets in the repo. Cloudflare bindings/secrets are deployment configuration.
